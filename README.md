## About the Project

This project is based on the [Odin Project Blog App](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/ruby-on-rails-ruby-on-rails). In this project, we create a blog application with Ruby on Rails following the [Jumpstart Lab’s Blogger Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html).

In this project we learned the basics of Ruby on Rails including below:

- Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
- Data Structures & Relationships
- Routing
- Migrations
- Views with forms, partials, and helpers
- RESTful design
- Adding gems for extra features

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
